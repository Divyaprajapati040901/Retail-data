# Retail-data


In this retail dataset project, I'm conducting data cleaning, preparation, and visualization tasks to enhance data quality. Utilizing regression models, I aim to predict relevant retail metrics. Upon model development, I plan to deploy it and create a dashboard for accessible insights and decision-making.


In this project, utilizing retail data sourced from Kaggle, I undertake comprehensive data modification tasks. Initially, I drop redundant columns, conduct data cleaning to rectify inconsistencies or missing values, and preprocess the data to ensure its suitability for analysis. Subsequently, I engage in exploratory data analysis (EDA) to unveil patterns, correlations, and insights, employing visualization techniques to enhance interpretability.

Following EDA, I proceed with regression analysis, employing predictive modeling to uncover relationships between variables and forecast outcomes. Leveraging machine learning algorithms, I train and evaluate regression models to discern influential factors driving retail performance.

Upon model validation, I deploy the trained model using a pipeline approach, streamlining the process for future use. Additionally, I design and develop a dashboard using Power BI, facilitating intuitive data visualization and interaction. The dashboard offers stakeholders a user-friendly interface to explore insights, trends, and predictions derived from the regression analysis.

Overall, this project encompasses the entire data science pipeline, from data preprocessing and analysis to model deployment and visualization, aimed at optimizing decision-making processes and enhancing understanding of retail dynamics.
